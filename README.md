Summary: Developed a dynamic data model in Power BI to analyze the sales data of a global office products distributor. The dataset, sourced from the Global Super Store Dataset 2016, includes sales of office supplies, furniture, and electronic devices worldwide. The objective is to identify the company's top-selling products, high-performing salespeople, and regions with growth potential. The project involved importing the Excel dataset into Power BI, linking the three available tables (Orders, Returns, and People), establishing appropriate relationships, assigning regions to individuals, and formatting numerical and date columns. The resulting data model enables the company to make informed business decisions based on sales performance across different products, salespeople, and regions.
